## The color fields

For this one I wanted to learn how to take randomness and form a smooth transition from a randomly generated number. By spending some time relearning trig and learning a few new commands like oscilation I was able to create a system that generated circles in a grid with randomized radiuses that then grew and shrunk based on the same way a sine wave goes from -1 to 1. Really weird but really cool to look at and I think I did a really good job of including randomness and you can additionally use the mouse to shift the color actively every frame.
